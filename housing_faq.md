# YIMBY FAQ
Just some of my personal oppinions on housing policy and YIMBYism.

## What's a YIMBY?
Yes In My BackYard is what the acronym stands for. It's a direct opposite of the term "NIMBY", which is used to describe someone who opposed all construction, development, or change of any kind in the neighborhood they live in.

## Isn't this just just making money for developers?
There is money to be made building housing for markets that desperately need it, this does not make the act of building that housing harmful.

## Is this just another term for gentrification?
Gentricifation is the act of displacing people and communities, especially those of color, from the the neighborhoods they've been for decades or longer. While new development can boost the property value of buildings around it, a scarcity of housing goes much further towards making areas unaffordable for populations of renters.

## The problem isn't a lack of housing, it's all the greedy developers buying up the housing market! We should just ban corporate ownership of houses
More of a claim than a question, but this has actually been explored! The city of Rotterdam did exactly this and saw no significant effect on home prices. However, the supply of rental units sharply declined and the neighborhoods which enacted this policy saw significant demographic changes.
