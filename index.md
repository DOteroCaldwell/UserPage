First-year transfer student at UCSD studying Computer Science; expected graduation **Fall 2026**. Passionate about [sustainability](#sustainability), [housing equity](#housing), and [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu](#brazilian-jiu-jitsu).

## Sustainability
This are where links to sustainability resources go.

## Housing
Easily one of the most pressing issues of our time is our national shortage of housing, especially in the urban centers where many people wish to live for the job opportunities, proximity to friends, and urban ammenities. As a self-identified progressive YIMBY, I try to follow what policy actions are happening to combat this crisis.

## Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

I've been personally faciscnated by the parallels between Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and programming for years. More than any other martial art I've practiced, BJJ seems to lend itself to an engineering mindset. Consider the following pseudocode that might describe a jiu jitsu player's gameplan 

```
def spider_guard_gameplan_v1(opponent):
  try:

    # Step 1: Pull guard and establish spider guard grips
    establish_grips(opponent.sleeves)
    pull_spider_guard()

    # Step 2: Control distance and destabilize opponent
    while not opponent.is_off_balanced():
      adjust_tension_in_legs()
      attempt_lasso_sequence()

  except GripBrokenException:
      # React to broken grips: re-establish guard or switch to another guard
      if opponent.is_passing():
        de_la_riva_gameplan(opponent)
      else:
        reestablish_spider_grips()

  except GuardPassedException:
    # If guard is passed, go into recovery mode
    reguard_sequence()
    look_for_inversion()

  finally:
    # Keep calm and look for submission opportunities
    breath()
    explore_submissions()
```

This example gameplan, often represented as a decision tree, but here as pseudocode, can now be tested and iterated upon through multiple rounds of rolling and competition against many different opponents. The discrete catagorization of jiu jitsu moves and posistions and the relatively low impact hard sparring has on your body lends itslef surprisingly well to a design/testing framework.
